# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting
A clean, modular project demonstrating multivariate time-series forecasting using a stacked LSTM model, a baseline MLP regressor, and full model explainability through SHAP and Integrated Gradients. Includes synthetic dataset generation, preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and saved model artifacts.

What the Project Does

This project builds a complete multivariate time-series forecasting system using deep learning.
It:

Generates a synthetic dataset with 5+ features and 1500+ time steps

Preprocesses the data into sequences for forecasting

Trains a stacked LSTM model with simple hyperparameter tuning

Trains a baseline MLP model for comparison

Evaluates both models using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE

Explains predictions using:

SHAP (KernelExplainer)

Integrated Gradients

Saves outputs including data.csv and the trained model forecasting_model.h5

Follows a clean, modular, production-style Python structure (main() pipeline + docstrings)

This provides a fully working forecasting pipeline suitable for study, research, or portfolio demonstration.


🌟 Why the Project Is Useful
